MobileAppProject
================

My mobile applications project is an app based on PewDiePie who is a youtube game vlogger.  This app has a brief description
on who he is.  It also incorporates rss feeds for his facebook, youtube and a link to some of his seperate videos.  Along with 
this, it has a twitter feed showing what people are saying about him and a bing search result based on his name.
